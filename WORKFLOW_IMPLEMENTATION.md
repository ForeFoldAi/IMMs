# Material Request Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive material request workflow system that handles the complete lifecycle from request submission to material receipt, with proper role-based access control and status management.

## Workflow States

### 1. **Pending Approval**
- Initial state when a request is submitted
- Awaiting Owner approval
- Only Owner can approve or revert

### 2. **Approved â†’ Ordered**
- When Owner approves the request
- Status automatically updates to "Ordered"
- Supervisor can now update material receipt

### 3. **Reverted**
- When Owner rejects/reverts the request
- Requires resubmission of indent form
- Supervisor status is also reverted
- Must provide reason for reverting

### 4. **Partially Received**
- When materials are partially received
- Supervisor updates with partial receipt details
- Can be updated multiple times until complete

### 5. **Material Received**
- Final state when all materials are received
- Complete receipt details recorded
- Workflow completed

## Key Components

### 1. **RequestStatusManager Component**
- Main interface for managing request status
- Role-based action visibility
- Handles Owner approval/revert actions
- Manages Supervisor receipt updates

### 2. **useRequestWorkflow Hook**
- Centralized workflow state management
- Status transition logic
- Permission checking
- History tracking

### 3. **WorkflowDemo Component**
- Interactive demonstration of the workflow
- Shows current status and progress
- Visual workflow steps
- Status history display

## Role-Based Actions

### **Company Owner**
- **Approve Request**: Changes status from "Pending Approval" to "Ordered"
- **Revert Request**: Changes status to "Reverted" with reason
- Can only act on "Pending Approval" requests

### **Site Supervisor**
- **Update Receipt**: Record material receipt details
- **Partial Receipt**: Mark as partially received
- **Complete Receipt**: Mark as fully received
- Can only act on "Ordered" or "Partially Received" requests

## Receipt Form Fields

When Supervisor updates material receipt, the following details are captured:

- **Purchased Price**: Total cost of materials
- **Purchased Quantity**: Actual quantity received
- **Purchased From**: Supplier/vendor name
- **Received Date**: Date of receipt
- **Invoice Number**: Reference number
- **Quality Check**: Pass/Fail/Partial status
- **Notes**: Additional remarks
